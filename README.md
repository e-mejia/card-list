# Getting Started with Create React App

# This is a single React app that displays a stati list of phone features. No functionality has been coded into it. This was more a fun project in the use of React to build the UI.

It uses the array map method to display the list. It consists of 5 functional components:

1.  Header
2.  CardList
3.  Card
4.  Footer

# Project is styled with a corresponding stylesheet.
